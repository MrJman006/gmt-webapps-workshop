# Lesson 2 - SPAs vs MPAs

Lesson 2 discusses the pros and cons of single page apps (SPAs) and multi-page
apps (MPAs). One of the major drawbacks of SPAs is having to implement client
side routing. This can be tricky to implement correctly. MPAs don't handle
client side routing and instead let the web browser handle it. This is a big
positive for MPAs since browsers already implement client side routing well.
Other characteristics of SPAs can also be pretty closely matched in MPAs using
service workers and various build processes.
