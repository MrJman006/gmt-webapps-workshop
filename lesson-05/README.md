# Lesson 5 - UI Reactivity

Lesson 5 gets into making a ui that reacts to data changes automatically.
Javascript proxies are one tool that can be used to implement ui reactivity.
The [reef](https://reefjs.com/) library also has a mechanism for creating a
reactive ui.

Lesson 5 has us improve the shop to show a cart icon in the navigation
section that shows the count of items in the cart. The cart count should
reactively update.
