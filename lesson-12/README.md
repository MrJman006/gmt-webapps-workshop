# Lesson 12 - URLs And Query Strings

Lesson 12 goes over how to manipulate the URL to pass temporary data
from one page to another using query strings. It also looks at how
to replace the URL without reloading the page or changing the window
history.

Lesson 12 has us use the URL concepts discussed to improve the usability
of our shop. Specifically making sure the cart is actually cleared after
a checkout reguardless of the page we redirect to while also showing a
checkout summary page.
