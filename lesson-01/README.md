# Lesson 1 - State Based UI

Lesson 1 goes over state based UI. We learned how to use template functions and
data objects together to simplify complex webapp layouts.

The project we will be working on for this workshop has us building an online
shop. The goal for lesson 1 is to use state based UI concepts to build out a
minimal product page for the online shop. It should show images and titles of
the available products. API errors should be handled appropriately and the user
should be notified.
